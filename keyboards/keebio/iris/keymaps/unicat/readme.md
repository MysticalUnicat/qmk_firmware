# Mystical Unicat's personal layout and animations

Base layer moves the gui key to the right, alt on left. for gaming, some games use alt, gui key is a mess on windows might as well move it away.
The space keys are also mapped to layer switch. if you need to hold space hold both.
backspace on left thumb turns on mouse layer.

Lower layer uses VIM movement on the right for arrows and mirror on left for home, pgdn, pgup, end, shifted of the other punctuation and number keys.

Raise layer has keypad on the right with numlock, rgb control on the left.

Mouse layer has simple mouse control mimicing VIM movement from above (arrow on right, wheel on left). gives access to game mode with second backspace. (top right key on right side).

Game layer is enabled over other layers, removes the layer on hold for space on the left side as many games likes holding spacebar and replaces the underscore shortcut on the base layer with ctrl-alt-v for voice chat shortcuts.

## animation

I liked reactive and raindrop. I made a way to do both. Split up the HSV contruction, Have two dynamic sources and a per frame generator.
